# Overview
This is a Next.js project designed for managing **Renters** and **Floors** within an **Apartment** or **Building**. The core functionality has been implemented, but the application is currently unstyled (CSS and other design elements will be added in the future).

# Features
1. **Building and Floor Management**: 
   - You can create **Buildings/Apartments** and add **Floors** within them.
2. **Renter Management**:
   - Renters can be added to specific floors. 
   - For each renter, you can maintain **Rent Details** for any given month.
3. **Delete Restrictions**:
   - Floors can only be deleted if they do not have any renters.
   - Buildings can only be deleted when there are no floors within them.

The applicationâ€™s backend functionality is complete, and you can explore the code for further details.

Future Enhancements
Styling and CSS will be added to improve the user interface and experience.
