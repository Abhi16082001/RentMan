# Overview
This is a Next.js project designed for managing **Renters** and **Floors** within an **Apartment** or **Building**. And **MongoDB** Database is used in this project. Total 3 collections inside the Database are used to make this project possible.

# Features
1. **Building and Floor Management**: 
   - You can create **Buildings/Apartments** and add **Floors** within them.
2. **Renter Management**:
   - Renters can be added to specific floors. 
   - For each renter, you can maintain **Rent Details** for any given month.
3. **Delete Restrictions**:
   - Floors can only be deleted if they do not have any renters.
   - Buildings can only be deleted when there are no floors within them.
4. **Login and Registeration System**:
   - On Registration Page, there will be owner registeration only but while creating floors, owner can create renter profiles and that will be stored in user database with owner flag false.

This project is now complete, and I'm not planning further updates and if you want you can explore.
